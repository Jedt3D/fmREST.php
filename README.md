# fmRESt.php

A free tool from soSIMPLE Software

Simplifies & manages PHP connections to FileMaker 16’s REST-based Data API.

We created this class file to make it easier to manage dynamic REST sessions for soSIMPLE and our custom development. The goal of the class file was to help PHP developers start using the new REST engine as quickly and easily as possible.

For documentation and support please visit out website:

We’ll also be updating it with new features. If you’d like to add something to it or have any comments, please let us know.
